# pyrqlaw
RQ-law feedback control for low-thrust orbital transfer and rendezvous in Python

### Dependencies

- `sympy`, `numpy`, `matplotilb`, `numba`

### Basic usage

Test files are included in `./tests/`. Here, we present a basic example whose complete code can be found in `./tests/rendezvous_with_coasting.py`. Before starting, please note a couple of things:

- Dynamics & spacecraft parameters are given in non-dimensional quantities, scaling `GM = 1.0` (which may be modified, but it is numerically desirable to use this scaling). 
- All angles are defined in radians.
- The RQ-Law formulation presents singularities when the eccentricity of the chaser's orbit is equal to 0 or 1 or its inclination is 180 degrees. Thus, initial circular orbits for either the target or chaser must be defined with small eccentricities on the order of 1e-3 and not 0. Similarly, retrograde orbits must be defined with inclinations slightly less than 180 degrees.
- A rendezvous maneuver is performed in two stages. Stage 1 is the orbital transfer aiming to match the chaser and target's slow elements (i.e., semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, RAAN, argument of periapse). Stage 2 is the phasing matching the position of the chaser and target after the chaser reaches the target's orbit at the end of stage 1. 

We start by importing the module

```python
#import sys
#sys.path.append("../")  # make sure the pyrqlaw folder is exposed
import pyrqlaw
```

Define the initial keplerian elements of the chaser and target, along with weighting. Stage 2 needs two additional weights compared to Stage 1. (The keplerian elements must be converted to the Modified Equinoctial Elements with the semi-latus rectum replaced with the semi-major axis before creating an RQLaw object.)

```python
# initial and final elements (always in order: [SMA, ECC, INC, RAAN, AOP, TA])
oe0 = np.array([1.03, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, np.pi])
oeT = np.array([1.05, 1e-3, , np.pi/2, np.pi/2, np.pi/2, np.pi/2])
woe1 = [2, 50, 50, 1, 1] # Stage 1 weights
woe2 = [10, 1, 1, 1, 1] # Stage 2 weights (set 1)
wl = 0.06609 # Stage 2 weights (set 2)
wscl = 3.3697 # Stage 2 weights (set 2)
```

Provide spacecraft parameters (max thrust and mass-flow rate), max transfer time, the relative effectivity tolerance for Stage 1, and initial time step for integration. (By default, the algorithm uses a Dormand-Prince 5(4) integration scheme).

```python
# spacecraft parameters
mass0 = 1.0
thrust = 4.6e-5
mdot = 1.1e-5
tf_max = 400.0
eta_r = 0.1
t_step = 0.001
```

Construct the problem object, then set the problem parameters

```python
prob = pyrqlaw.RQLaw()
prob.set_problem(oe0, oeT, mass0, thrust, mdot, tf_max, t_step, woe1=woe1, wo2=wo2, wl=wl, wscl=wscl)
prob.pretty()  # print info
```

```
Stage 1 orbital transfer:
  a  : 1.3136e+00 -> 1.4704e+00 (weight: 2.00)
  f  : 2.0000e-01 -> -1.0000e-03 (weight: 50.00)
  g  : 0.0000e+00 -> 1.2246e-19 (weight: 50.00)
  h  : 0.0000e+00 -> 6.1232e-17 (weight: 1.00)
  k  : 0.0000e+00 -> 1.0000e+00 (weight: 1.00)
```

Solve the problem

```python
prob.solve_stage1(eta_r=eta_r)
prob.solve_stage2()
prob.pretty_results()   # print info
```

```

```

Some conveninence methods for plotting:

```python
fig1, ax1 = prob.plot_elements_history()
fig2, ax2 = prob.plot_trajectory_3d()
```

### Some things to be careful!

- The `pyrqlaw` implementation was compared to the case studies presented in Ref. 4 which proposed the RQ-Law. For some of the examples, the outputs of pyrqlaw don't quite match the results from Ref. 4. For example, pyrqlaw for now struggles to converge to the target's position in highly elliptical orbits.
